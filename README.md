Performing digital watermarking using DCT-DWT-SVD::

Security is an important factor when a user is handling images,texts,audio as well as other files in the
digital era.It is very easy for an outsider to steal the information or contents.Such acts leads to loss of
property and other problems for the user.Thus,digital watermarking comes into play here.This process can
be done using multiple algorithms but this paper emphasizes on using DWT and DWT-DCT-SVD in order
to determine the robust model for digital watermarking.The PSNR value for both are determined and then
compared.
